React doesn't work on reloading pages. We cannot use <a> tags directly in a react application. Also, react router is used to migrate from one page to another. <Link/> is used in place of <a> tag, because <a> tag reload the page. 'href' is replace with 'to'. <NavLink/> is used to configure nav bar. In the main.jsx we render a single component called <RouterProvider router={router} />. The router executes a funcation createBrowerRouter and createRoutesFromElements. Which render a layout/outlet.
