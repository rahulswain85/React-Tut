Today I created a very simple project in React called background color changer. The color of the background changes on click of button. I used useState hook to manage the background color state. In the main div, in the stype attribute I used useState variable to set the color of background. Assigned on click on each button, and here comes the major learning. onClick expects a function and not return value, so we can't just directly call the useState setter, instead we will use a callback.
