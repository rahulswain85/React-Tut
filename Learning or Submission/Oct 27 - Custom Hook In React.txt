Today I created a currency converter react application. Understood and applied the concept of custom hooks in react. I created a custom hook called useCurrencyInfo. useCurrencyInfo takes a currency (string) as argument and fetch data using an API for that currency. In the useCurrencyInfo I used two react hooks i.e useEffect and useState. useEffect will fetch from the api, whenever the currency will change and update the data with new object using the useState hook. Then the data is returned.
