Today I created a password generator react app and learned about three hooks of react called useCallback, useEffect, and useRef. The useCallback hook is used to optimize a function. It memorize the function and caches it so that it's not recreated on every render. The useEffect hook triggers the function in it whenever the page is loaded or any of its dependency changes. The useRef hook is used to target a portion of page. It works for passing the ref attribute to the target element.
